The data for this project can be found at 'http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/fddb'. 
This repo expects the data to de extracted into a folder structure: project_directory/data/[2002, 2003, FDDB-folds]
The script FDDB.py attempts to do this automatically but permissions on some of the images
causes this to fail on my end. The script should generate the correct folder layout if there is any confusion
about that. 

All training of the Face model is located in the train jupyter notebook. Run each cell in 
order to train the model (* First cell is because of weird dependency issue between matplotlib and torch)
